## Prerequisites

In order to use this template, you should have a basic understanding of React and Apollo Client.

<a name="run"></a>

## Running the Boilerplate

	1. git clone https://github.com/regisBafutwabo/react-typescript-boilerplate.git <YOUR PROJECT NAME>
    
	2. cd <YOUR PROJECT NAME>
    
	3. rm -rf .git : remove the git folder and initiate your own git ...
    
	4. yarn (or npm i )

	5. yarn start (or npm start)

<a name="env"></a>
## `.env` Configuration

By now, I think you have realized that the apollo folder relies on some kind of server link. Here is the way to setup your `.env` file if you are planning to use it:
1. create an environment file (`.env`) in your root folder
2. populate using the `.env.example` file :
	
		REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_PROTOCOL = http

		REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_HOST =  localhost

		REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_PORT =  4000

		REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_VERSION = v1

		REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ROUTE = graphql

		REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET = 1234

## Features

- **Typescript** - A superset of Javascript providing static typing, classes and interfaces.
- **Apollo Client** - A fully-featured caching GraphQL client with integrations for React which allows you to easily build UI components that fetch data via GraphQL.[Learn More](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)
- **Apollo Cache Persist** - Utilizes async storage to persist and rehydrate the Apollo store
- **React Router DOM** - A collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application.
- **Styled Components** - Powerful CSS in JS module providing template literals to support dynamic styling.[Learn More](https://styled-components.com/)
- **Ant Design** - An enterprise-class UI _design_ language and React UI library with a set of high-quality React components, one of best React UI library for enterprises.[Learn More](https://ant.design/)
- **EsLint/Prettier/Airbnb linting style** - Enforces code styling, and standards. Airbnb's tslint guidelines are followed by default.
- **React-i18next** - A powerful internationalization framework for React based on i18next.[Learn More](https://react.i18next.com/)
- **Test** - Testing support for React and apollo client.
- **Storybook** - Enables developers to test UI components in isolation.[Learn More](https://storybook.js.org/)
- **Server Connection** - Used to setup a connection a hasura or GraphQL API server.[Learn More on Hasura](https://hasura.io/)

## Folder Structure

This is a setup of the `src` folder structure:
		 
		 src/
		 |── apollo                 # contains all the apollo client setting and server settings							
		 |── app		            # contains the Routing of the application 
		 |── assets                 # contains the images and other medias needed throughout the app
		 |── components             # contains the reusable components (Atomic Design Structure)
		 |── generated              # contains the graphql file generated by graphql-codegen
		 |── locales                # contains every languages that the app will use throughout the app
		 |── pages                  # contains all the pages of the app
		 |── stories                # contains all the stories being used in StoryBook
		 |── styles                 # contains the custom styles and global styles
		 |── types                  # contains all the Typescript declaration files 
		 └── utils                  # contains all the extra helper function that can be used in the app

## Setup Explanation

<a name="apollo"></a>
### apollo

This folder is where everything that has to do with apollo and graphql API is setup.

	src/apollo/
	├── cache                     # contains the cache setup files
	├── middlewares               # contains every file that has something to do with the API
	└── state                     # contains every apollo client state(basically the store) and its resolvers and queries

<a name="components"></a>
### components

This folder contains our reusable components. It is based on [atomic design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).
There are five distinct levels in atomic design:
- [Atoms](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#atoms)
- [Molecules](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#molecules)
- [Organisms](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#organisms)
- [Templates](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#templates)
- [Pages](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/#pages)

> **Note:** In this boiler plate `Pages` is out of the components folder ( My preference 😅)

	src/components
	├── atoms                    
	├── molecules               
	├── organisms                
	└── templates

<a name="locales"></a>
### locales
This folder contains all of the languages that you will be using in your project

	src/locales
	├── en
	│   └── translation.json
	└── ko
	    └── translation.json

> **Note:** You will learn how to extract all of the languages  of your app with a script command in the [scripts](#scripts) section

<a name="stories"></a>
### stories
this folder contains all of your storybook components. For more information on stroybook and how to create stroies. [click here.](https://storybook.js.org/docs/basics/introduction/)

<a name="scripts"></a>
## Running the `scripts` command


**start**: starts the application

**build**: generate a production-ready `build` folder in your root folder

**test**: run an overall test based on every test file contained in the project

**lint**: lintify all of the `.ts`and `.tsx` files based on our `.eslintrc` file

**gen**: generate TypeScript typings out of your GraphQL schema

**extract**: extracts all the texts that are not in the translation files and add them

**storybook**: starts the storybook server/app
